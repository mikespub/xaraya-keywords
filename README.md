## Overview

### What is it?

*Keywords is a Xaraya Utility Module.* The Keywords module allows you to
assign keywords to module items (taxonomy) and to look up items by
keyword. To use keywords in your content items you must [hook the
Keywords
module]() to any
module or itemtype where where you want to use it.

### How to use it?

After enabling the keywords hooks for a particular module and itemtype,
you'll see an input box when entering content in the module item. Here
you can fill in relevant keywords whenever you create or modify a module
item. When viewing an item that has keywords associated, you can
retrieve a list of other items having the same keyword(s).

You can also restrict keywords to a predefined set of words. Further you
can make them specific for each hooked module and itemtype.

In the future this module may try to extract keywords automatically from
other fields on create/update. Contributions in that or other directions
are welcome :-)

### Included Blocks

There are no included blocks at this time. However you can use Keywords
in your Meta Block. The keywords from your Keyword module for any given
item (eg an article) are inserted into your webpage page keyword
metatag.

### Included Hooks

  - new/create/modify/update/delete -- Allows you to create/update
    keywords
